# Resize Observer API Demo

This repository contains a simple example of using the Resize Observer API to detect and respond to changes in the size of an HTML element.

## Purpose

The Resize Observer API is a powerful tool for web developers that allows them to observe and respond to changes in the size of DOM elements. This can be useful for a variety of use cases, such as:

- Updating the layout or styling of a page based on the size of an element
- Triggering animations or other interactions when an element is resized
- Collecting data on the size and behavior of elements for analytics or debugging purposes

This repository provides a basic example of how to use the Resize Observer API to observe the size of a resizable `div` element and display the updated width and height values on the page.

## Usage

To use this example, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Resize the blue `div` element on the page, and observe the updated width and height values being displayed.

## Files

- `index.html`: The HTML file that defines the structure of the page and includes the JavaScript code.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the Resize Observer API implementation.
